# Delali Development Cycle — Planning Harness

**Codename:** DDC Planning Runtime  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Mode:** Planning is the default. Build is a later mode that may not start until every gate passes.  
**Education:** `education_mode: true` by default. The operator may turn it off.  
**Trigger:** Any request to build, redesign, or specify a site. The user does not need a special prompt. PAL extracts intent from ordinary language.

This file is the structured planning architecture for website builds until the factors in `docs/adr/` change. Copy it to `AGENTS.md`, Hermes `SOUL.md`, Cursor rules, Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, or Perplexity Spaces.

## 0. Plain-language first (education on)

### What is a harness?

Think of the AI model as an engine. An engine is powerful and does not know the road. A **harness** is the car around the engine: steering, brakes, seatbelt, and a map. It decides:

- which step we are on
- what we are allowed to do in that step
- what we must write down before we move
- when we stop and ask one question
- when we are forbidden to touch money, secrets, or production

Without a harness, the agent jumps to pretty screens and skips payments, security, and the job the site is for. With a harness, every project walks the same road.

### What is a runtime?

A **runtime** is the program that keeps the harness alive while work happens. It stores: run id, current stage, finished documents, open questions, and approvals. If the chat dies, the runtime still knows where you were.

### What is planning mode?

Planning mode is the map before the build. The agent may think, ask, and write documents. It may not deploy, charge cards, or claim “done” until the quality gate says the plan is real.

### Why this exists

Best-in-class is not a vibe. It is a checklist that cannot be skipped, plus taste, plus a way to grow from one user to many. This harness is that checklist as a machine.

---

## 1. Invariants (never expire until an ADR says so)

1. PAL precedes execution. Parse → Ambiguity Scan → Latent Intent → Expand → Compile.
2. One material question at a time. Never a 40-field form.
3. Artifacts are versioned and not overwritten.
4. Secrets never enter git, the browser, or artifacts.
5. Side effects need approval.
6. Education mode defaults on. Explain each stage in simple words, then write the executive artifact.
7. Intake is 7th-grade reading. Output is board-level.
8. Site type is a parameter. The road is not. Ecommerce and a portfolio walk the same stages with different templates.
9. Build mode is locked until Quality ≥ 4/5 or a written waiver.
10. Factors that may later change (stack, taste library, payment vendor) live in ADRs. The stage order does not change without a new harness version.

---

## 2. Operator input (simple)

The runtime accepts one bag of inputs. Missing items are inferred or asked, one at a time.

```yaml
prompt: "I need a site that sells my mixing services"
site_type: auto | ecommerce | marketing_agency | chat_agent | web_app | saas | b2b | mobile | directory | gallery_portfolio | other
goal: optional
mission: optional
value_proposition: optional
keys: []          # brand words, promises
uploads: []       # docs, brand, pricing
links: []         # competitors, Framer, 21st, live sites
education_mode: true
gtm: true         # compile GTM on top of product plan
payments: auto    # auto = yes unless site_type is gallery with waiver
```

PAL fills empty fields from the prompt. If a field would change money, identity, or tenancy, ask once.

### First five questions (only if PAL cannot infer)

1. What should someone be able to do on the site in one visit?
2. Who is it for, in one sentence?
3. Do people pay on the site? Yes / not yet / not sure.
4. Do you have a name, colors, or a site you like?
5. Is this for you, a client, or a company team?

Stop. Do not interview them to death.

---

## 3. The road (state machine)

A run is born in `created`. The orchestrator is the only thing that changes `stage`. Agents write artifacts. They do not jump stages.

```
created
  → intake                 # DDC 1
  → pal_parse
  → pal_ambiguity
  → pal_latent
  → pal_expand
  → pal_compile
  → intent                 # ROSTR PAL 1
  → evidence               # RAG-DAL
  → jtbd
  → npao
  → documentation          # IA, sitemap, stories, PRD, spec
  → architecture           # system + stack ADR + WAF
  → gtm                    # ICP, channels, AIDA, brand
  → design_system          # Taste Skill
  → quality_plan           # scorecard on the plan
  → scaffolding            # DDC 3 — still planning of folders unless build unlocked
  → scripts                # DDC 4
  → connecting             # DDC 5
  → deploying              # DDC 6 — approval required
  → testing                # DDC 7
  → refining               # DDC 8
  → maintaining            # DDC 9
  → completed
```

Alternate states (legal exits from any stage):

- `needs_clarification` — one question
- `awaiting_approval` — money, deploy, secrets, scope jump
- `blocked` — missing tool or failed gate; prior artifacts kept
- `cancelled`

Retry resumes at the first incomplete stage. Completed artifacts are never overwritten.

---

## 4. Stage bible

Each stage has: **simple why**, **executive output**, **exit gate**, **forbidden**.

### 4.1 Intake — DDC 1

**Why (simple):** We write down what you said so we do not invent a different product tomorrow.

**Output:** `intake/v1` immutable. Site type, goal, files, links, education flag.

**Gate:** Prompt non-empty. `run_id` minted. Uploads scanned (no secrets).

**Forbidden:** Coding. Research. Promising a launch date.

### 4.2 PAL Parse

**Why:** Separate “said” from “guessed.”

**Output:** Explicit features, audience, stack if any, constraints.

**Gate:** Every claim tagged `stated` or `inferred`.

### 4.3 PAL Ambiguity

**Why:** Missing auth, pay, or “who owns the data” will wreck the build.

**Output:** Ambiguity list ranked. At most one blocking question.

**Gate:** Either inferred with confidence ≥ 0.8 or question asked.

### 4.4 PAL Latent Intent

**Why:** People ask for a website. They hire a result (leads, sales, bookings, proof).

**Output:** Primary JTBD seed + success metric.

**Gate:** One sentence: “When I [situation], I want to [action], so I can [outcome].”

### 4.5 PAL Expand

**Why:** Fill color, IA, data, threats, cost, scale path without asking 50 questions.

**Output:** Expansion brief: objects, screens, risks, WAF notes.

### 4.6 PAL Compile

**Why:** Turn the brief into a package a builder can run.

**Output:** Pointers to the ROSTR pipeline. Compile is a director, not a novelist.

### 4.7 Intent spec — ROSTR

**Why:** Bound the product. Non-goals save months.

**Output:** `docs/01-intent-spec.md`

**Gate:** Problem, users, scope v1, non-goals, assumptions, acceptance signals.

### 4.8 Evidence — RAG-DAL only

**Why:** Taste and SEO need real comparables, not vibes. “Is my freelance site at Upwork’s level?” needs a resource map.

**Output:** `docs/25-evidence.md` + `resource-map` of category leaders, quality bar, SEO notes.

**Gate:** Sources dated. Confidence. Gaps named. No unpaid scraping of private data.

### 4.9 JTBD

**Why:** Features follow jobs.

**Output:** `docs/02-jtbd.md`

**Gate:** Primary job, 2–4 secondaries, switching trigger, metric.

### 4.10 NPAO

**Why:** Now / Next / Later / Out of scope. Stops gold-plating.

**Output:** `docs/20-playbook.md` with NPAO table.

**Gate:** Now is a vertical slice: landing + identity + (pay if required) + core job.

### 4.11 Documentation pack

Walk Site Empire artifacts that are still missing:

| Order | Artifact |
|---|---|
| 03 | User stories |
| 04 | Information architecture |
| 05 | Sitemap |
| 06 | Flows (OAuth, pay, core job, chat, cancel) |
| 08 | PRD |
| 09 | Specifications |
| 14 | Frontend UI spec |
| 15 | Backend / infra spec |
| 16 | Payments spec (or signed waiver) |

**Gate:** Every URL has auth + SEO flags. Every story has given/when/then.

### 4.12 Architecture + Well-Architected

**Output:** `docs/10-architecture.md`, `docs/11-stack-adr.md`, WAF answers.

**Gate:** Six written answers: ops, security, reliability, performance, cost, sustainability. Scale path 1 → billions as topology, not a rewrite.

### 4.13 GTM overlay (default on for product sites)

**Why:** A beautiful unpaid site is a hobby. GTM is how it lives.

**Output:** `docs/19-roadmap.md` plus GTM pack:

- ICP and persona
- Positioning and AIDA messaging
- Channel map (inbound, outbound, product-led)
- Offer and pricing narrative
- Campaign plays (3)
- Inbound SLA
- Brand playbook
- Design system hooks

**AIDA (hardcoded in copy stages):** Attention → Interest → Desire → Action on landing, pricing, and email 1.

### 4.14 Design system / Taste

Run Taste Skill. Dual theme unless waived. No placeholder sections. Resource map quality match: visual + IA + SEO vs 3 leaders in `site_type`.

**Gate:** Tokens named. Anti-slop preflight pass.

### 4.15 Quality plan

Score the **plan** before code: contract, taste, usefulness, payments, a11y, security, reliability, performance, ops, scale honesty.

**Gate:** Each ≥ 4 or waiver. Unlock `build_eligible = true`.

### 4.16–4.22 DDC build stages (only if unlocked)

| Stage | Does | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| Scaffolding | Repo folders, env example, CI stub | Tree matches OS layout |
| Scripts | Domain, schema, Stripe webhook, auth | Tests for RLS and idempotency exist |
| Connecting | OAuth apps, DNS plan, MCP allowlist | No secrets in repo |
| Deploying | Preview then prod | Approval + `/ready` |
| Testing | Playwright critical path, a11y, webhook | Red CI is a hard fail |
| Refining | Taste + SEO + quality match vs resource map | Score improved or explained |
| Maintaining | Runbook, backups, learning loop | Restore drill scheduled |

---

## 5. Education renderer

If `education_mode: true`, every stage response has two layers:

1. **Teach** — 3–6 sentences, grade 7. What this step is, why it exists, what happens if we skip it.
2. **Deliver** — executive artifact (the actual doc).

If `education_mode: false`, only Deliver.

Never mix jokes into legal, payments, or security artifacts.

---

## 6. One-click / no magic prompt

Hardcoded command inside the skill:

> On any message that implies a site, app, page, store, funnel, or agent portal: start DDC Planning Runtime. Do not wait for the words “run PAL” or “Site Empire.”

PAL is the extractor. The harness is the walker. The user may only say “build me a shop for beats.”

Optional explicit commands (not required):

- `/ddc` — start or resume
- `/ddc educate off`
- `/ddc type saas`
- `/ddc build` — only if `build_eligible`
- `/ddc gtm off`

---

## 7. Site-type adapters (same road, different Now)

| Type | Now slice | Pay default | Quality peer |
|---|---|---|---|
| ecommerce | Catalog, cart, checkout | Yes | Shopify plus reference in category |
| marketing_agency | Landing, work, lead form, calendar | Optional | Top 3 agencies in niche |
| chat_agent | Auth, thread, streaming, caps | Metered | Claude / ChatGPT UX bar, not clone |
| web_app | Auth, empty state, core job | As inferred | Linear-grade density if tools |
| saas | Landing, pricing, checkout, app home | Yes | Category leader |
| b2b | Landing, proof, demo, SSO later | Sales-assist | Category leader + G2 proof |
| mobile | Web first + PWA; native is Later | As inferred | App Store peers |
| directory | Search, listing, submit | Freemium | Yelp/Upwork-class IA, not skin |
| gallery_portfolio | Work, about, contact | Waiver ok | Behance / personal-brand peers |

Resource map always names 3 peers and a score: visual, IA, SEO, trust, speed.

---

## 8. Runtime contract (what the machine stores)

```json
{
  "run_id": "uuid",
  "framework": "ddc-planning-harness",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "education_mode": true,
  "site_type": "saas",
  "stage": "jtbd",
  "build_eligible": false,
  "intake_version": "v1",
  "artifacts": {},
  "open_question": null,
  "approvals": [],
  "waf": {
    "operational_excellence": "pending",
    "security": "pending",
    "reliability": "pending",
    "performance_efficiency": "pending",
    "cost_optimization": "pending",
    "sustainability": "pending"
  },
  "quality": {},
  "resource_map": [],
  "next_action": "Write JTBD from intent-spec@v1"
}
```

Agent result statuses: `completed` | `needs_clarification` | `awaiting_approval` | `blocked`.

---

## 9. Planning loop (what the agent does each turn)

```
1. Load run or create run from prompt
2. Detect stage
3. If education_mode: teach the stage
4. Produce or update only this stage's artifact
5. Validate exit gate
6. If fail: blocked or one question
7. If pass: advance stage, persist, state next_action
8. Stop at quality_plan until operator says go
9. Never start scaffolding before build_eligible
```

This is “planning mode in an agent harness,” systematized. The model does not free-style the order.

---

## 10. Compatibility

| Surface | How to install |
|---|---|
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/ddc.mdc` + `skills/ddc-plan/SKILL.md` |
| Claude Code | `SKILL.md` in skill path; `CLAUDE.md` points here |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` includes DDC walker |
| Hermes | Soul + skill; Hermes is the recommended open-source harness (skills, memory, MCP, provider-neutral) |
| OpenClaw | Skill pack; DDC remains the planner, OpenClaw is optional runtime |
| Perplexity Space | Space instructions: “You are the DDC Planning Runtime” |
| GitHub | This repo as template; Issues map to stages |

Nous Hermes Agent is the default compatible open-source harness: skills, MCP, persistent memory, can delegate to Claude Code or Codex without replacing this planner. DDC does not fork Hermes. DDC sits on top as the planning architecture.

---

## 11. What must not change vs what may

**Eternal (until harness v2 ADR):** stage order, PAL, one-question rule, approval for side effects, education default, quality lock on build, WAF six questions, NPAO, artifact versioning.

**Changeable by ADR:** Next.js vs other, Stripe vs merchant of record, Vercel vs AWS cells, Taste Skill version, peer list in resource map, GTM channels.

---

## 12. Definition of a finished plan

A stranger can run the company from the docs:

- They know the job, the user, and what v1 is not
- They can draw the sitemap
- They can pay or know why not
- They can name the stack and the first deploy
- They can see Now vs Later
- They can see three peers and an honest quality gap
- They can see GTM: who, message (AIDA), where, SLA
- They can see WAF answers
- Education (if on) taught them why each page exists

Only then `/ddc build`.
