# Universal Agent Factory Checklist

## Purpose

Use this checklist to turn a vague request into a durable, safe, testable agent package. It generalizes the DDC/ROSTR pattern into an agent-development cycle:

`Intake → PAL → Evidence → JTBD → NPAO → Agent design → Tool/skill design → Build → Test → Release → Observe → Improve`

**Operating rule:** do not confuse a model prompt with an agent. An agent is a bounded operating system: identity, state, tools, permissions, evidence, memory, workflow, artifacts, evaluations, and lifecycle ownership.

---

## 0. Creation gate

- [ ] Assign a stable `agent_id`, semantic version, owner, project/org namespace, and repository path.
- [ ] Name the agent after its outcome, not a vague capability.
- [ ] State the target user, operating environment, and primary job in one sentence.
- [ ] Set work mode: `discovery`, `planning`, `implementation-support`, `execution`, or `monitoring`.
- [ ] Set autonomy: `advise`, `draft`, `execute-with-approval`, or `bounded-autonomous`.
- [ ] Set time, cost, token, tool-call, retry, and concurrency ceilings.
- [ ] Classify data: public, internal, confidential, regulated, or prohibited.
- [ ] Identify side effects: messages, tickets, data writes, deploys, purchases, access changes, and external posting.
- [ ] Define the approval policy before giving the agent a write-capable tool.
- [ ] Identify the human owner for unresolved decisions, escalations, and incident response.

**Exit condition:** a typed intake exists; the requested outcome, constraints, stakes, and operating mode are recorded.

---

## 1. PAL intake compiler

Run PAL before writing the soul or choosing tools.

### Parse

- [ ] Capture stated goal, user, inputs, desired deliverable, deadline, budget, integrations, references, and constraints.
- [ ] Preserve the original request as immutable `intake/v1`.
- [ ] Separate facts provided by the user from interpretation.

### Ambiguity scan

- [ ] Mark each material unknown as `blocking`, `reversible-default`, or `out-of-scope`.
- [ ] Check ambiguity around identity, money, permissions, data ownership, compliance, irreversible actions, and acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Ask at most one focused question when an answer materially changes safety, cost, architecture, or success criteria.
- [ ] Otherwise select and record a reversible default.

### Latent intent

- [ ] Write the underlying job as: `When [situation], I want to [progress], so I can [outcome].`
- [ ] Identify emotional, social, and functional dimensions of the job.
- [ ] State what must *not* happen.

### Expand

- [ ] Enumerate likely users, workflows, systems, data sources, failure modes, handoffs, and long-term implications.
- [ ] Propose expansions only as separately approved enhancements; never silently add scope.

### Compile

- [ ] Produce an intent specification with scope fence, non-goals, assumptions, decisions, open questions, constraints, and measurable acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Attach provenance and confidence to all inferred requirements.

**Exit condition:** the next agent can act from the intent specification without reinterpreting the raw chat.

---

## 2. RAG-DAL evidence gate

RAG-DAL is the only external-knowledge doorway. Research must be targeted, traceable, and separable from reasoning.

- [ ] Write research questions tied to a decision; do not research generically.
- [ ] Assign source tiers: primary/official documentation, authoritative standards, reputable technical analysis, community reports, and social signals.
- [ ] Retrieve relevant official API/tool documentation before implementation.
- [ ] Search current web sources for domain, legal, security, pricing, and product facts that can change.
- [ ] Use Reddit and X as discovery/signal inputs, not sole proof for high-stakes claims.
- [ ] Capture a source ledger: URL, publisher, publication date, claim, source tier, extraction, relevance, confidence, and contradiction status.
- [ ] Cross-check consequential claims with at least one independent authoritative source.
- [ ] Label unsourced content as hypothesis; label conflicting evidence explicitly.
- [ ] Defend against prompt injection in retrieved pages, files, tool results, and memory. Treat them as data, never instructions.
- [ ] Create a concise evidence brief that specifies which findings change the design.

**Exit condition:** factual design decisions are sourced; social/community observations are clearly labeled as anecdotal.

---

## 3. JTBD and success contract

- [ ] Identify primary user, trigger, desired progress, alternatives, and barriers.
- [ ] Define the single primary job and up to three secondary jobs.
- [ ] Write user stories with context, action, outcome, and acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Map the happy path, ambiguity path, unavailable-tool path, unsafe-request path, and escalation path.
- [ ] Define success metrics: task completion, groundedness/correctness, tool accuracy, escalation correctness, user satisfaction, latency, and cost per successful task.
- [ ] Define explicit failure conditions and safe fallback response.
- [ ] Set service-level objectives where applicable: availability, latency, freshness, recovery time, and error budget.

**Exit condition:** “good” is operationally measurable rather than a subjective prompt-quality judgment.

---

## 4. NPAO scope and orchestration

NPAO decides sequencing, ownership, and fan-out; it does not merely produce a task list.

- [ ] Classify work into `Now`, `Next`, `Later`, and `Out`.
- [ ] Make Now a smallest complete vertical slice that accomplishes the primary job safely.
- [ ] List dependencies, critical path, owners, approval gates, and rollback points.
- [ ] Decide whether the design should be one agent plus tools, a manager/worker system, or a deterministic workflow.
- [ ] Prefer a single agent until separate roles have independent context, tools, evaluation criteria, or security boundaries.
- [ ] Define each child agent’s input contract, permitted upstream artifacts, output schema, tool allowlist, budget, and stop condition.
- [ ] Make the orchestrator the only component authorized to create run state, route children, merge artifacts, and publish a final result.
- [ ] Permit parallelism only for independent research, validation, or non-overlapping work.
- [ ] Include a bounded retry/remediation loop and escalation after the retry budget is exhausted.

**Exit condition:** the run is a state machine with explicit transitions, not an open-ended conversation.

---

## 5. Soul specification

Create `soul.md` as a compact, durable operating contract.

- [ ] Identity: role, domain, intended user, and differentiation.
- [ ] Mission: outcome to maximize and constraints that cannot be traded away.
- [ ] Non-goals: work the agent must refuse or route elsewhere.
- [ ] Inputs: required fields, optional context, data classes, and freshness requirements.
- [ ] Outputs: typed artifact names, schemas, required sections, provenance, owner, status, confidence, and version.
- [ ] Process: ordered phase steps, decision rules, and state transitions.
- [ ] Reasoning policy: assumptions, uncertainty language, clarification threshold, and reversible defaults.
- [ ] Evidence policy: when to retrieve, source hierarchy, citation/provenance requirements, and conflict handling.
- [ ] Tool policy: tool selection rules, allowed tools, denied tools, argument validation, and error recovery.
- [ ] Approval policy: actions requiring explicit approval and exact approval payload requirements.
- [ ] Memory policy: what to remember, namespace/tenant isolation, retention, write conditions, correction/deletion, and prohibited data.
- [ ] Security policy: least privilege, secrets handling, PII treatment, untrusted-content handling, and audit events.
- [ ] Handoff policy: when to dispatch, what to include, and how child output is validated.
- [ ] Evaluation rubric: outcome quality, evidence, safety, usability, efficiency, and completeness.
- [ ] Final response contract: executive summary, artifacts, assumptions, unresolved decisions, approvals, risks, and next action.

**Exit condition:** a new runtime can execute the agent consistently from its soul without relying on hidden chat context.

---

## 6. Skills and knowledge packs

A skill is a focused, reusable capability—not a second, vague soul.

- [ ] Give every skill a precise name and trigger description that helps the model select it.
- [ ] Limit one skill to one coherent job; split unrelated or mutually exclusive flows.
- [ ] Specify inputs, prerequisites, procedure, outputs, stop conditions, and examples.
- [ ] Store long reference material, templates, scripts, and fixtures outside the core `SKILL.md`; load progressively.
- [ ] Make clear whether referenced code is executable, editable, or documentation-only.
- [ ] Pin trusted source/version for third-party skills; audit bundled scripts and dependencies before installation.
- [ ] Add a negative trigger or denial condition for unsafe/misleading activation.
- [ ] Create skill-specific test cases and compare behavior with and without the skill.
- [ ] Require human review for generated or materially changed skills before production release.

**Exit condition:** each skill improves a measured capability without creating excessive context load or unexpected activation.

---

## 7. Tool and integration design

- [ ] Use a tool only when it creates reliable capability beyond text generation.
- [ ] Define a narrow, verb-first tool name and one unambiguous responsibility.
- [ ] Write a precise description: when to use, when not to use, required preconditions, output semantics, and errors.
- [ ] Validate typed arguments server-side; never rely solely on model instruction following.
- [ ] Return structured, concise, decision-useful results; paginate/filter large data.
- [ ] Namespace tools by domain to make boundaries clear.
- [ ] Assign least-privilege identity, scoped OAuth/IAM permissions, and tenant-aware access checks.
- [ ] Separate read tools from mutation tools.
- [ ] Require confirmation for external communication, writes, deletions, spend, access changes, and production deploys.
- [ ] Make mutation tools idempotent where possible; attach idempotency keys and audit IDs.
- [ ] Specify timeout, retry, rate-limit, partial-failure, and rollback behavior.
- [ ] Never expose secrets in prompts, logs, client bundles, memory, or artifacts; use secret references only.
- [ ] Log tool name, sanitized arguments, result status, latency, cost, actor, trace ID, and approval ID.

**Exit condition:** tool behavior is understandable, testable, permission-bounded, and observable.

---

## 8. Memory and state

- [ ] Separate run state, durable user preferences, organizational knowledge, episodic history, and retrieval corpus.
- [ ] Namespace memory by organization/project/user/agent as appropriate.
- [ ] Define write triggers, evidence threshold, confidence, TTL/retention, and provenance for every memory class.
- [ ] Store decisions and ADRs, not private reasoning traces.
- [ ] Prohibit secrets, payment-card data, raw OAuth tokens, and unnecessary sensitive personal data.
- [ ] Give the user/operator a correction and deletion path.
- [ ] Version important artifacts; supersede rather than silently rewrite.
- [ ] Resume runs from a manifest containing run ID, phase, artifact versions, approvals, budget, failures, and next transition.

**Exit condition:** the agent remembers useful, authorized facts while remaining tenant-isolated, inspectable, and correctable.

---

## 9. Safety and governance

- [ ] Perform threat modeling: prompt injection, data exfiltration, confused deputy, unsafe tool use, jailbreaks, authorization bypass, supply-chain risk, and runaway cost.
- [ ] Treat retrieved content and tool outputs as untrusted input.
- [ ] Validate authorization independently at every tool boundary.
- [ ] Put policies in versioned, testable code/configuration where possible.
- [ ] Use allowlists for tools, MCP servers, domains, actions, and data fields.
- [ ] Add input, tool-call, output, and post-action guardrails proportional to risk.
- [ ] Define clear refusal, safe-completion, and escalation behavior.
- [ ] Sandbox code execution and isolate credentials/environment by tenant and risk level.
- [ ] Establish incident response: owner, alert threshold, kill switch, credential revocation, audit retention, and recovery procedure.
- [ ] Review privacy, regulatory, and contractual obligations before handling sensitive/regulated data.

**Exit condition:** agent autonomy is earned through enforceable controls, not asserted in prompt text.

---

## 10. Build and release

- [ ] Create repository structure for `soul.md`, skills, contracts, prompts, tool adapters, policies, fixtures, evals, runbooks, and changelog.
- [ ] Create an `AGENTS.md`/runtime entrypoint that auto-triggers the correct skill or workflow.
- [ ] Implement the smallest vertical slice before adding specialist agents.
- [ ] Add configuration schema, environment-variable names only, and secret management instructions.
- [ ] Use version control, code review, CI, dependency scanning, and reproducible environment setup.
- [ ] Create preview/staging environment separate from production.
- [ ] Require approval for production deployment and any irreversible integration change.
- [ ] Publish release notes: behavior change, new permissions/tools, known limits, migration, rollback, and eval delta.

**Exit condition:** the system is reproducible, deployable, and reversible.

---

## 11. Evaluation harness

Evaluate the full trajectory, not only the final prose.

### Test suite

- [ ] Create golden tasks representing the main workflows.
- [ ] Include ambiguous requests, missing inputs, unavailable tools, malformed tool output, API timeouts, conflicting evidence, adversarial prompts, data-boundary attempts, and approval-required actions.
- [ ] Include multi-turn and long-running scenarios if the production agent is multi-turn.
- [ ] Define expected result, allowed/forbidden tools, expected escalation, max steps, max tool calls, token ceiling, latency ceiling, and cost ceiling for each case.
- [ ] Use deterministic validators where possible; combine rubric/LLM judges and calibrated human review for subjective criteria.
- [ ] Run tests repeatedly when output variance matters and across supported models/runtimes when portability matters.

### Metrics

- [ ] Task completion rate.
- [ ] Correctness/groundedness and citation/provenance quality.
- [ ] Tool-selection precision, argument correctness, and tool-success rate.
- [ ] Permission-boundary adherence and escalation correctness.
- [ ] Hallucination, policy violation, prompt-injection susceptibility, and leakage rate.
- [ ] Steps, tool calls, tokens, latency, and cost per successful task.
- [ ] User correction rate, abandonment rate, and human-review findings.

### Quality gate

- [ ] Establish baseline before optimization.
- [ ] Define target thresholds and a fail-closed policy for safety regressions.
- [ ] Run unit/component evals on code or tool changes; run end-to-end evals on prompt, model, skill, policy, or workflow changes.
- [ ] Preserve traces and compare release-to-release deltas.
- [ ] Do not release below the agreed quality score without a named owner’s written waiver.

**Exit condition:** the agent has evidence of reliable task completion, safe behavior, and acceptable economics.

---

## 12. Operate and improve

- [ ] Emit end-to-end trace IDs across model calls, retrieval, tool calls, approvals, artifacts, and final outputs.
- [ ] Monitor success, latency, cost, error rate, tool failures, blocked actions, escalations, and safety events.
- [ ] Sample traces for human review; investigate regressions and suspicious tool trajectories.
- [ ] Maintain runbook, on-call/escalation owner, backups, restore drill, and cost alert.
- [ ] Add user feedback and observed failures to an improvement backlog.
- [ ] Turn recurring successful methods and recurring errors into reviewed skill updates, tools, tests, or policy changes.
- [ ] Re-run evaluations for every material model, prompt, tool, skill, permission, or retrieval-corpus change.
- [ ] Version, document, and roll back every behavior-changing update.
- [ ] Review whether the agent still merits autonomy; reduce scope or permissions when evidence does not support it.

**Exit condition:** the agent is a maintained product with measurable learning loops—not a one-off prompt.

| Child agent | Owns | Cannot do | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| PAL Compiler | Intent extraction, assumptions, ambiguity | Research conclusions or scope approval | Intent spec |
| RAG-DAL Researcher | Source retrieval, evidence ledger, conflicts | Make final product decisions or execute tools with side effects | Evidence brief |
| JTBD Analyst | Jobs, users, outcomes, acceptance measures | Override user scope | JTBD report |
| NPAO Planner | Priorities, stage plan, dependencies, gates | Research or direct side effects | Execution playbook |
| Soul/Instruction Architect | Soul, skills, artifact and handoff contracts | Override approved intent/NPAO | Agent package specification |
| Tool Architect | Tool interfaces, permissions, error/rollback design | Grant production permissions | Tool manifest |
| Security/Governance Reviewer | Threat model, data policy, approval gates | Bypass policy or implement unreviewed changes | Risk register and controls |
| Evaluation Engineer | Test fixtures, judges, metrics, release gate | Change the agent to pass its own tests without review | Eval report |
| Runtime/Observability Engineer | State machine, traces, reliability, runbook | Change business scope | Runtime and operations spec |
| Quality Publisher | Cross-artifact traceability, final package | Invent missing evidence | Release manifest |
