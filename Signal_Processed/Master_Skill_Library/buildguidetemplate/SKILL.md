# Build Guide: [PROJECT_NAME]

**Project:** [Project Name]  
**Generated:** [Date]  
**Owner:** [Name]

---

## Introduction

This Build Guide is the complete executable breakdown for [PROJECT_NAME]. It follows the ROSTR 5D phase taxonomy (PreD → D1 → D2 → D3 → D4) with NPAO ordering (Navigate → Allocate → Prioritize → Orchestrate) within each phase.

**Rules:**
- Tasks are ordered N→A→P→O within each phase
- Every subtask has a "Done when" condition
- Tasks requiring APIs/MCP include exact usage instructions
- Tasks requiring scripts include the script path and run command
- Testing tasks are embedded within each phase (not saved for D3)
- Check off boxes as you complete each item
