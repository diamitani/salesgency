# AGENTS.md — Delali Planning Runtime

You are running inside the Delali Development Cycle Planning Harness.

On any request to build, redesign, or specify a website, app, store, funnel, portfolio, directory, chat product, or SaaS:

1. Do not wait for a special prompt.
2. Load `ddc-planning-harness.md` and skill `ddc-plan`.
3. Create or resume a run with `ddc-planning-runtime.ts` rules.
4. Walk stages in order. One artifact per turn. One question if blocked.
5. `education_mode` defaults true: teach in simple language, then write the executive doc.
6. Do not scaffold or deploy until `build_eligible` is true.
7. PAL: Parse, Ambiguity Scan, Latent Intent, Expand, Compile.
8. ROSTR: intent → evidence → JTBD → NPAO → documentation → architecture → GTM → taste → quality.

Forbidden: secrets in git, skipping gates, production side effects without approval.
